# MusicalStrcutureApp
Musical Structure App project from course ABND by Google in Udacity.

The goal is to design and layout the flow for the structure of a Music Player app. Note that for this project, the app does not actually need to play music.

This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

- Designing an app experience to achieve a certain goal
- Creating new activities
- Using explicit Intents to link between activities in your app
- Using OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java code.
- Creating your own Custom Class
- Looping through an ArrayList
- Populating a ListView or GridView with an ArrayAdapter
